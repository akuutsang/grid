            üëâ For the cross axis, things are a bit different. We use the
            align-items property. align-items has all the 12 options
            justify-content t is only relevant to the cross axis, it also has
            some options justify-content doesnt have.

            but the only difference is that, align-self goes into the item and
            not the parent container <br />and it allows you using to change the
            alignment of a specific child along the cross axis. <br />
            eg notice how this particular item alings to the center, unlike the
            other items? this is align-self at work.

        <h4>Growing and Shrinking in Flexbox</h4>
        <p class="sub-head">
          Flexbox algorithm has some built-in flexibility, with
          <i>hypothetical sizes.</i>
          to see how fluid flexbox is, we need to consider these 3 properties:
          <b> flex-grow,</b>
          <b>flex-shrink,</b>
          <b>and flex-basis.</b>
        </p>
      </header>
      <div class="second-container">
        <div class="section-two">
          <h2>Flex-basis</h2>
          <p class="para-one">
            In a Flex row, flex-basis does the same thing as width. In a Flex
            column, flex-basis does the same thing as height. Flexbox is pegged
            to the primary/cross axis. For example, justify-content will
            distribute the children along the primary axis, and it works exactly
            the same way whether the primary axis runs horizontally or
            vertically. width and height don't follow this rule, though! width
            will always affect the horizontal size. It doesn't suddenly become
            height when we flip flex-direction from row to column.
          </p>
          <p class="para-two">
            The Flexbox authors created a generic ‚Äúsize‚Äù property called
            flex-basis. It's like width or height, but pegged to the primary
            axis, like everything else. It allows us to set the hypothetical
            size of an element in the primary-axis direction, regardless of
            whether that's horizontal or vertical.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, we can use width and flex-basis interchangeably in a
            Flex row, but there are some exceptions. For example, the width
            property affects replaced elements like images differently than
            flex-basis. Also, width can reduce an item below its minimum size,
            while flex-basis can't. It's well outside the scope of this blog
            post, but I wanted to mention it, because you may occasionally run
            into edge-cases where the two properties have different effects.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-two">
          <h2>Flex-grow</h2>
          <p>
            By default, elements in a Flex context will shrink down to their
            minimum comfortable size along the primary axis. This often creates
            extra space. We can specify how that space should be consumed with
            the flex-grow Flex-grow basicallt tells your web application how to
            share available space, between items
          </p>
          <p>
            The default value for flex-grow is 0, which means that growing is
            opt-in. If we want a child to gobble up any extra space in the
            container, we need to explicitly tell it so. What if multiple
            children set flex-grow? In this case, the extra space is divided
            proportionally between children based on their flex-grow value.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-two">
          <h2>Flex-shrink</h2>
          <p>
            flex-shrink controls how much a flex item shrinks when there isn‚Äôt
            enough space in the flex container you could think of it as the
            opposite of flex-grow
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine all your toys (flex items) are on a shelf (the flex
            container). If your shelf starts getting crowded: A toy with
            flex-shrink: 2 will shrink more to make room. A toy with
            flex-shrink: 0 says, ‚ÄúNope! I stay the same size!‚Äù So the squishy
            ones make space, but the tough ones don‚Äôt.
