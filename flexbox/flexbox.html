          Flexbox is all about controlling the distribution of elements in a row
          or column

          we can flip to a column with the flex-direction property

        <div class="box">
          With flex-direction: row, the primary axis runs horizontally, from
          left to right. When we flip to flex-direction: column, the primary
          axis runs vertically, from top to bottom.

          <div class="items">
            ðŸ‘‰ When it comes to the primary axis, we don't generally think in
            terms of aligning a single child. Instead, it's all about the
            <i>distribution of the group.</i>
          </div>
          <div class="items">
            ðŸ‘‰ justify-content has about 12 options you can use to distribute
            the children on the primary axis, which are: baseline, center, end,
            first baseline, last baseline flex-start, flex-end, left, right,
            safe, space around and space between
          </div>

          <div class="items">
            ðŸ‘‰ We can bunch all the items up in a particular spot (with
            flex-start, center, and flex-end), or we can spread them apart (with
            space-between, space-around, and space-evenly). always remember,
            justify-content is relevant to the <i>primary axis</i>.
          </div>
          <div class="items">
            ðŸ‘‰ For the cross axis, things are a bit different. We use the
            align-items property. align-items has all the 12 options
            justify-content t is only relevant to the cross axis, it also has
            some options justify-content doesnt have.

            ðŸ‘‰ It is important to note, both justify-content and align-items,
